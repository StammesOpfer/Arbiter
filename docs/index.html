    <h1>Arbiter</h1>
    <h2>A way to make VMware vCenter and FreeIPA work together. <br> Schema updater and group member syncing.</h2>
    Built on vSphere 7 and FreeIPA 4.10 (should support at minimum vCenter 6.5 - 8.0)
    
    Arbiter creates the schema that vCenter expects (`groupOfUniqueNames` and `uniqueMember`) and permissions to view those new attributes. It also populates the attributes and syncs the FreeIPA `member` attribute to the `uniqueMember` attribute that vCenter reads and uses. This means your FreeIPA groups now work in vCenter.
